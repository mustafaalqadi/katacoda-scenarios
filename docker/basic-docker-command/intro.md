# What Is Docker?
Docker describes themselves as "an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications".
Docker allows you to run containers. A container is a sandboxed process running an application and its dependencies on the host operating system. The application inside the container considers itself to be the only process running on the machine while the machine can run multiple containers independently.
